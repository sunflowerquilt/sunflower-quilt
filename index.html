<h1>Standard Quilt Sizes - Sunflower Quilt Geembi</h1>

<div class="container">

<p>You love <a href="https://geembi.com/collections/lifestyle/sunflower/">sunflower quilt</a> but do you know how to choose the right size for your bed? The first step in planning is to decide the final size.</p>

<p>The wall space available to hang the finished project should be considered when determining the size and length of the hanging. You may have a specific quilt rack or hanger that you need to fit your finished quilt.</p>

<p>Make sure you consider who is going to be throwing it. Are they small children or tall adults? Do they prefer to wrap it in a blanket or lay it on their laps? The optimum size should be determined based on your usage results.</p>

<p>Below are the resources for bed-sized quilts. You may want to measure the size of the mattress you plan on making for your quilt. Mattress heights can vary. Consider whether you want the quilt folded under and then over the pillows, as well as how low you would like it to hang (comforter length, coverlet length, or bedspread length).</p>

<h2>Measurement of a bed to determine quilt size</h2>

<p>These instructions will help you measure your bed and determine the size of your quilt. For more information on measuring, see the images. Measure the quilt using blankets, sheets and pillows. Drop is the portion of the quilt that extends beyond the mattress' edge. If you wish to cover your pillows with your quilt, "Tuck" will be the section of the quilt that folds underneath them. It can be either shallow (10") or deeply (20"). Noting: The quilt's overall size can be affected by the amount of quilting and the type of batting used. Shrinkage can also occur when the quilt is washed or dried.</p>

<h3>Width</h3>

<p>Add twice the drop length to the mattress width. To make a comforter-sized project, measure from the top edge of the mattress to the bottom. This will give you the drop length. Measure from the top edge of the mattress to the base of the bed rail for a coverlet. Measure from the top edge of the mattress to the floor for a bedspread.</p>

<h3>Length</h3>

<p>Measure the length of your mattress and add 10-20 inches to the length for the pillow tuck. The size of your pillows, as well as the depth of your pillow tuck will determine how much you need to add. Measure the length of your mattress and add 12 inch to your quilt.</p>

<h2>How to adjust the size of a quilt</h2>

<p>There are many options for making changes to a pattern that will make a quilt smaller or larger than you originally intended. You may need to alter the relationship between the different elements of a quilt when changing parts. To see how changes will affect the final size and appearance of your quilt, you should first sketch your ideas on graph paper.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you might not have enough blocks to complete the quilt center. You can reorganize the blocks to make the quilt top smaller. Alter the number or number of rows, or remove blocks.</p>

<p>You can make the quilt top smaller by removing some blocks. In this case, you can add sashing between rows to regain some inches. You can also use narrower sashing if you don't want to reduce the number of blocks.</p>

<p>You can make a smaller quilt top by adding more blocks or setting squares. You can increase or decrease the width of the sashing or use a diagonal (on-point) block layout.</p>

<p>You might consider changing the block size if you are still in the planning stage.</p>

<p>You can alter the final size of the quilt by changing the border. This will allow you to reduce or increase the border width as well as create an additional border. Remember to keep in mind the ratio of borders to finished quilt.</p>
